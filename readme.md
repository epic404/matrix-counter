We are given a matrix M of the order m x n, and we have to print its elements as we traverse it in spiral form.

Example 1:

Input: 
13  14  17  27
81  52  31  10
12  55  23  78

Output:
10 12 13 14
55 78 81 17
52 31 27 23

Explanation: We are printing the matrix starting from the top left corner and going spiral from there.
